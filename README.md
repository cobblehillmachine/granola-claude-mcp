# Granola-Claude MCP Server

> **Transform your meeting data into AI-powered business intelligence**

A custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects [Granola.ai](https://granola.ai) meeting data directly to Claude Desktop, enabling natural language queries across your entire meeting history.

## üöÄ Why This Exists

While Granola-MCP was documented across the web with detailed feature lists and installation guides, **the actual repository and PyPI package didn't exist**. Rather than wait for an official release, we reverse-engineered Granola's local cache structure and built a comprehensive MCP server from scratch.

**The result?** Ask Claude questions like:
- *"Show me all client meetings from last month where we discussed budget"*
- *"Which team members need follow-up from the Enron project meetings?"*  
- *"Analyze our meeting patterns with external clients vs internal team meetings"*

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç **Natural Language Meeting Intelligence**
- Query 273+ meetings using plain English
- Search across titles, content, and participant lists
- Instant access to meeting metadata and calendar integration

### üìä **Advanced Analytics**
- Meeting statistics and pattern recognition
- Attendee analysis and engagement tracking
- Project timeline reconstruction from meeting history

### üîó **Complete Integration**
- Google Calendar event details and attendee responses
- Conference links (Google Meet, Zoom) and participation status
- Rich metadata including organizers, response status, and sharing settings

### üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy-First Architecture** 
- All data processing happens locally - no cloud uploads

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- **macOS** with Granola.ai installed and configured
- **Python 3.12+** 
- **Claude Desktop** application
- Active Granola meeting history

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/granola-claude-mcp.git
   cd granola-claude-mcp
   ```

2. **Make the server executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x granola_mcp_server.py
   ```

3. **Test the installation**
   ```bash
   python3 test_granola.py
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Cache loaded successfully!
   üìä Statistics: [your meeting data]
   üìÖ Recent meetings: [your recent meetings]
   ```

4. **Configure Claude Desktop**
   
   Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "granola-mcp": {
         "command": "python3",
         "args": ["/path/to/granola-claude-mcp/granola_mcp_server.py"],
         "env": {
           "GRANOLA_CACHE_PATH": "/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Granola/cache-v3.json"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   
   Quit completely (‚åò+Q) and restart Claude Desktop.

6. **Test the integration**
   
   Ask Claude: *"Show me my recent Granola meetings"*

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Granola.ai ‚Üí Local Cache ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Claude Desktop ‚Üí AI Intelligence
```

### Cache Structure
Granola uses a sophisticated "double-JSON" encoding:
```python
# Standard JSON file containing JSON string
cache_data = json.loads(data['cache'])
state = cache_data['state']

# Three primary data collections:
documents = state['documents']        # 273+ meeting records
metadata = state['meetingsMetadata']  # 28 relationship objects  
transcripts = state['transcripts']    # 16 available transcripts
```

### MCP Protocol Implementation
- Full MCP 2025-06-18 protocol compliance
- Proper initialization and capability negotiation
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Real-time query processing with sub-second response

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Server Failed" in Claude Desktop
1. Check the logs: Claude Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Open Logs Folder
2. Verify file paths in your configuration
3. Test server manually: `python3 granola_mcp_server.py`

### "No meetings found"
1. Ensure Granola.ai has processed meetings
2. Verify cache file exists: `ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/Granola/`
3. Check cache file size (should be several MB for active users)

### Python/Permission Issues
1. Verify Python 3.12+: `python3 --version`
2. Make server executable: `chmod +x granola_mcp_server.py`
3. Check file permissions on Granola cache directory

### MCP Connection Issues
1. Restart Claude Desktop completely (‚åò+Q, then reopen)
2. Validate JSON syntax in claude_desktop_config.json
3. Check environment variable path matches your username
